This project aims to explain how thermoelectricity can be used to make a vehicle go up a
ramp using a tea light and a Peltier device. The vehicle will also use a heat sink and a motor
to make the car run, along with other design elements to ensure a functioning vehicle. This
report will also cover some of the testing done to ensure the vehicle runs, along with
showing calculations of the efficiencies. Additionally, this report will cover the theoretical
maximum heights and accelerations of thermoelectric vehicles. A CAD image of the file
will also be provided.
